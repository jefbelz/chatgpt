So by solving that to my clients, they now are super happy with me, their friends seem me, they speak about me with other people, I can change a bit more and it saves my clients money.

But guess what? My clients in the Netherlands had a different idea!\n\nThe weather here is mostly gray & depressing. But, I was capturing moments at happy festivals and weddings, and my clients wanted their photos to be full with vibrant colors and pure joy! They didn‚Äôt want moody shots. they wanted their memories to come alive!\n\nSo I went looking for those vibrant presets but all the beautiful presets I found were making the green look gray which I can‚Äôt have because the Netherlands is completely green! Thats where I understood I needed to create my own Lightroom presets to give my photos that wow factor and have my clients happy, I wanted them to be full of life.\n\nToday, I‚Äôm thrilled to share my creation with you. The GOLD presets are the secret to capturing the true essence of your memories, ensuring each shot is filled with breathtaking colors and pure joy.",

Or i just remove things with the content, aware option in Lightroom itself which doesn‚Äôt take too long. I know some photographers get mad when clients ask to photoshop, the problem is that the clients don‚Äôt know how much extra work it is so simply educating them is the best solution i found.
