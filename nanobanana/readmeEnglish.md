# üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide: Getting Your NanoBanana API Key and Setting Up the Photoshop Script

## Why You Need This
The Photoshop script connects to NanoBanana's AI models (like Nano-Banana / Flux Kontext). To do this, it needs permission to talk to NanoBanana's servers. That permission is granted through an **API key** ‚Äî a long secret code that works like a password. 

üëâ Without this key, the script cannot run AI models inside Photoshop.

## 1. Create or Log In to a NanoBanana Account

1. Open **https://nanobananaapi.ai/** in your browser.
2. Click **"Explore Features"** or **"Start"** button.
3. You'll see a login modal with two options:
   - **Google Account**: Click the Google button to sign in with your Gmail
   - **Microsoft Account**: Click **"Sign in with Microsoft"**

4. Complete the verification process:
   - You'll see a CAPTCHA verification with **"I am human"**
   - Check the box to verify you're human

‚úÖ After logging in, you'll be redirected to your NanoBanana dashboard.

## 2. Navigate to API Keys Section

3. You'll see your API key management page with:
   - Your existing API key (partially hidden for security)
   - Creation date
   - Options to manage your key

## 3. Get Your API Key

1. In the API Keys section, you'll see a key labeled **"Default"**.
2. Click the **copy button** next to your API key to copy it to clipboard.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This is secret ‚Äî never share it publicly. Treat it like your password.
3. Keep this key safe - you'll need it for the Photoshop script.

## 4. Check Your Credits (Optional Top-up)

üí° **Good news!** Your account comes with **50 free credits** already topped up for testing purposes.
